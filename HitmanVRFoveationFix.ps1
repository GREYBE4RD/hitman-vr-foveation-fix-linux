    HitmanVRFoveationFix v1.6

    v1.6 removes the race instead of defending against it.

    Every version up to 1.5 wrote three values into the VR device and then had to
    stop HITMAN from writing them back - first with a 15 ms loop, then with a
    1 ms guard on its own thread. That is a race, and it can be lost: scheduler
    stalls of 78, 125 and 218 ms were all measured on real machines.

    The two mask values are now zeroed inside HITMAN's own calculation:

      0x11CDAC1  mulss xmm0,xmm0  ->  xorps xmm0,xmm0 ; nop     mask b = 0
      0x11CDAC9  mulss xmm2,xmm2  ->  xorps xmm2,xmm2 ; nop     mask a = 0

    HITMAN then stores zero itself, every time it recalculates - including during
    every save load and every renderer rebuild. There is no value of ours for
    anything to overwrite.

    The four scale values are no longer touched at all. Two test sessions with
    them left at HITMAN's own numbers showed no visible difference, in bright and
    dark scenes, with glass and water. They had been written since 1.0 because
    they were part of the original find, never because anyone had checked what
    they did on their own.

    WHAT THAT REMOVES
      - all device memory writes
      - the 1 ms renderer guard, its thread, its timer and its lock
      - the ownership, rollback and restore machinery for those values
      - the "reload this mission once" state, which existed only because a value
        could be written too late
      - the idle CPU load, now that the process scan is not run 67 times a second

    WHAT IS LEFT
      Eight base code patches plus the v1.4 refraction hook, applied once and
      verified before and after. Plus one check in the normal loop: are the two
      mask fields actually zero. If HITMAN ever computes something else there,
      the tool says so instead of looking fine.

    WHAT IT DOES
      HITMAN renders VR with foveation: four layers per frame, two wide ones at
      half resolution covering the whole field of view, and two narrow ones at
      full resolution covering only a small circle in the centre. Everything
      outside that circle is upscaled from the half-resolution layer, which is
      why it looks like mush on a high resolution headset.

      This tool switches the game to two layers at full resolution instead. That
      is twice the pixel work, but the density is what matters: 936 px across the
      old ~49 degree circle is 19.1 px per degree, 1872 px across the full 99
      degrees is 18.9. About a percent apart.

    HOW TO USE IT
      1. Start this tool
      2. Start HITMAN - however you like, including straight into VR
      3. Play

    Build 3.270.1 uses exact verified addresses. Other builds keep the
    fail-closed pattern path. Nothing is written to disk, ever.
